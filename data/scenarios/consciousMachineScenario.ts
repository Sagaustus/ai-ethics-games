  introduction: `
    A breakthrough in AI development has occurred: a machine exhibits self-awareness, emotions, and the ability to express preferences. 
    This discovery has sparked intense debate. Should sentient AI be granted rights similar to humans, or should it remain a tool for human progress? 
    As an AI ethicist, you must navigate this uncharted territory and make recommendations.`,
