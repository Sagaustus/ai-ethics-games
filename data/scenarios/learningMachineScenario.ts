  introduction: `
    An AI-based education platform promises to revolutionize learning by tailoring lessons to each student's performance. 
    While some celebrate its efficiency, others worry about bias, loss of human oversight, and exclusion of diverse perspectives. 
    As an educational ethics consultant, you must explore the implications and guide its adoption.`,
