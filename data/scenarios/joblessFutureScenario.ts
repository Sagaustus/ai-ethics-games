  introduction: `
    Advances in AI technology have led to widespread automation, displacing workers across industries.
    While businesses benefit from increased efficiency and profits, unemployment is rising rapidly.
    You are an advisor to the government tasked with balancing economic growth and the welfare of displaced workers.
    What policies will you propose to address this crisis?`,
